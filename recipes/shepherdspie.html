        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic British and Irish dish that’s loved the world over, shepherd’s pie is the ultimate comfort food. Made with lamb mince, a rich gravy and buttery mashed potatoes, this recipe has all the elements for a perfect Sunday dinner and is on the table in just over an hour. We love the addition of Worcestershire sauce as it brings a deep umami flavour and a sweet, tangy and spicy punch all at once.</p>
