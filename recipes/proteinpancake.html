        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Protein pancakes are a delicious and nutritious twist on traditional pancakes, providing an extra boost of protein to help fuel your day.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>40 g vanilla protein powder</li>
            <li>1 very large ripe banana</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp. cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In two clean bowls, separate the eggs carefully so none of the yolk gets into the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg whites on high for 2 minutes until they form soft peaks. (It is important that your bowl or beaters don't have any oil, fat or yolks on them, or the egg whites won't form peaks. Soft peaks are defined as barely holding their shape. The peaks flop over immediately when the beaters are lifted.)</li>
            <li>Add the egg yolks along with the remaining ingredients to a medium bowl and beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Gently fold 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the banana mixture until roughly combined. Fold half of the remaining eggs whites into the mixture and finally the last portion until everything is well combined.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over low heat. Scoop 1/4 c. of the mixture onto the skillet and cook for 60-90 seconds on each side.</li>
            <li>OPTIONAL: Top with fresh fruit and/or 1/3 c. plain non-fat Greek yogurt mixed with 1 Tbsp. honey.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
