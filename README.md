# odin-recipes
I am going to create a recipes page using the basic HTML concepts learned 
throughout The Odin Project foundations course. This will include creating 
a boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, creating emphasis and strong text, 
including hyperlinks to other pages and include images.

Finished result - Was able to incorporate all of the information I have learned so far and are satisfied with the outcome.
